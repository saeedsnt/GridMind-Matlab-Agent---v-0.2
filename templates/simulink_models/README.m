%% Simulink Model Creation Templates
% This directory contains scripts and configuration files for creating
% Simulink models for power system analysis.
%
% Available Templates:
%
% 1. PowerFlow_Simulink.m
%    - Builds a Simulink-based power flow visualization model
%    - Requires Simscape Electrical toolbox
%    - Shows single-line diagram with voltage profiles
%
% 2. Stability_Simulink.m
%    - Creates a detailed transient stability simulation model
%    - Includes generator models with classical controllers
%    - Sets up disturbance blocks and signal capture
%
% 3. Protection_Simulink.m
%    - Builds relay coordination and protection schematic
%    - Includes current transformers, relay logic blocks
%    - Shows over-current and distance protection functions
%
% Usage:
%    Run from MATLAB command line or from the agent
%    Models will be created in the current working directory
%    Models follow IEEE naming conventions and best practices
%
% Notes:
%    - Requires MATLAB R2020a or later
%    - Simscape Electrical toolbox required for detailed power system models
%    - Models can be edited and extended for additional components
